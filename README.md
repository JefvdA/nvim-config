# nvim-config
This is my personal neovim configuration. Read the README for what I configured. 

# Editor setup
The setup itself is pretty straight-forward, and can just be found by looking at the `init.vim` file.

# Plugins
- vim-airline
- nerdtree

## NERDTree
For NERDTree a few extra shortcuts have been added:
- cntr + f -> focus the NERDTree
- cntr + n -> open NERDTree
- cntr + t -> toggle NERDTree
